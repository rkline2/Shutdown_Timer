# Shutdown_Timer
**Windows Users Only!**

**Description:**
Shuts the computer down in 2 hrs and turns off any monitors. Mainly used for installing large updates/software/etc. at 2 am and want to go to bed.

**Important Info:**
- To start the program click on Launcher
- If you want to cancel the shutdown timer click on Cancel_Shutdwn
- If you bumped into your mouse and your screen turned on, click on Turn_Screen_Off

**Updates:**
Will tweak some additional addons if needed. Would like to have the user enter the time they want the computer to shutdown instead of just 2 hrs
