# Shutdown_Timer
**Windows Users Only!**

**Description:**
Shuts the computer down in 2 hrs and turns off any monitors. Mainly used for installing large updates/software/etc. at 2 am and want to go to bed.

**Important Info:**
If you want to cancel the shutdown timer go to CMD and type "shutdown /a". 

**Updates:**
Will tweak some additional addons if needed. Would like to have the user enter the time they want the computer to shutdown instead of just 2 hrs
